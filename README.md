# Covid-19-Cases-Prediction in Malaysia using LSTM
This is my first project sharing to Github, even though the model isn't working out great, but the code itself could provide a surface understanding on how to do a single step and multi step model.

The project assigned was to create a prediction for Covid-19 Cases in Malaysia. The windows date is 30 days which is quite big for small dataset. 

The hardest part in this project is to increase the accuracy of the prediction.

Go through the `code folder` to find the code for the prediction.

Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to explore the deep learning!
